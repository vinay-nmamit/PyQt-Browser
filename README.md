This document outlines the creation of a simple browser application using PyQt.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:

1. **Install the `venv` module:**

   ```bash
   pip install python3-venv

    Navigate to your project directory:

    cd <project-directory>

Create the virtual environment:
---
Bash

python3 -m venv <virtualenv-name>

Replace <virtualenv-name> with your desired name (e.g., pyqt_browser_env).

Activate the virtual environment:
---

Depending on your operating system, use one of the following commands:

    Linux/macOS:
    Bash

    source <virtualenv-name>/bin/activate

Windows:
Bash

<virtualenv-name>\Scripts\activate.bat

Dependencies
---

Install the necessary libraries within your activated virtual environment:
---

pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine

Running the Application
---

    Navigate to your project directory:
    Bash

    cd <your-project-directory>

    Use code with caution.

Run the script:
---

python3 pyQt-browser.py
